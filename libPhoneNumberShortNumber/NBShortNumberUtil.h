/**

 * calling code is shared by multiple regions, then it returns the highest cost in the sequence
 * PREMIUM_RATE, UNKNOWN_COST, STANDARD_RATE, TOLL_FREE. The reason for the position of
 * UNKNOWN_COST in this order is that if a number is UNKNOWN_COST in one region but STANDARD_RATE
 * or TOLL_FREE in another, its expected cost cannot be estimated as one of the latter since it
 * might be a PREMIUM_RATE number.

 * For example, if a number is STANDARD_RATE in the US, but TOLL_FREE in Canada, the expected
 * cost returned by this method will be STANDARD_RATE, since the NANPA countries share the same
