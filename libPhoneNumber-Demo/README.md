# **libPhoneNumber-iOS Demo App**

This iOS application project provides demonstrations on how to implement key features of libPhoneNumber-iOS, 
libPhoneNumberShortNumber, and libPhoneNumberGeocoding.

The default project - libPhoneNumber-Demo uses Cocoapods to download the open-source projects associated with libPhoneNumber-iOS.

The SPM project - libPhoneNumber-Demo-SPM uses Swift Package Manager to pull in the open-source projects associated with libPhoneNumber-iOS.

Both projects rely on the same source code and were made using SwiftUI.

```
